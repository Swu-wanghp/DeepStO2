**Figure 1.** Overview of the StO₂-based deception detection dataset.  
Each participant completes multiple **structured tasks** (e.g., personal information description, factual statements, and mock-crime scenarios) under controlled illumination and fixed camera–subject geometry. For every trial, a **baseline segment** and a **task segment** are recorded and converted into spatial StO₂ maps.

### 📊 Dataset Overview:
  - |
    The Deception-Detection-StO₂ dataset includes three experimental paradigms with increasing stress intensity:
    1. Personal Information Description — low stress  
    2. Factual Statement — moderate stress  
    3. Mock Crime — high stress  

    All hyperspectral data were captured under calibrated halogen illumination
    to ensure uniform facial lighting and stable reflectance estimation.

### 🧠 Model Overview:
  - |
    OxyRIG-Net adopts a two-stage “attribute first, reason later” framework:
    - Stage I: Physiology-guided regional attribution using ACCA and soft facial priors  
    - Stage II: Multi-relation graph reasoning over ROIs (spatial, bilateral, functional)  

    This enables interpretable and robust deception detection
    through both localized oxygenation variation and cross-regional coupling.
